the program reads from the console a natural number
(integer >0) and displays whether the number is an Armstrong number or not. Armstrong numbers are the integers equal to the sum of their digits raised to the number of digits.
E.g. number 153 is Armstrong as the crowd of
of its digits is 3 and 153 = 13 + 53 + 33, unlike 1210 for which 1210 <> 14 + 24 + 14 + 04
